# Exploratory Data Analysis (Wine Quality Dataset)

## Project Description

In this project **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** was performed based on both red wine and white wine.

The main goals were:
- Perform data cleansing.
- Explore distributions of features and the target variable.
- Plot and analyze relationships between features.
- Calculate and visualize correlation matrix and mutual information.

This project is focused on EDA and does not involve any machine learning modeling.
